Stella finds herself following the ocean breeze to the quiet shores of Northern Australia, where she meets a Yolŋu fisherman mending his net.
Stella: Do you know about my missing star? Is it from the hunter? From a hearth?
Fisherman: Hunter? Hearth? No, no. That’s Djulpan, the canoe that sails the sky.
Fisherman: One of the canoe’s stars was a fish that leapt overboard, plunging into the dark sea. Without all three stars, the canoe is incomplete.
